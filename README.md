# Knowledge Base UI 

User Interface for viewing my [Knowledge Base](https://github.com/thesofakillers/knowledge-base), built with
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) using a modified version of the [digital-garden
template](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template)

## Details

The \_notes directory is actually a clone of my knowledge base linked above.
This is handled via [git-subrepo](https://github.com/ingydotnet/git-subrepo)

## License

Source code is available under the [MIT license](LICENSE.md).
