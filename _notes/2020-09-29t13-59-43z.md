When dealing with [time series](./2020-09-23t15-18-55z.md), it is often
desirable that the series we are dealing with is stationary.

Stationarity is met if:

- The mean $\mu$ of the time series is constant
- The standard deviation $\sigma$ of the time series is constant
- There is no [seasonality](./2020-09-29t14-15-02z.md)
