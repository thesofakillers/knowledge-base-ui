A _Just-in-Time_ Compiler is a compiler that compiles portions of a program at
run-time, i.e. while the program is running. For the program to be running,
a JIT compiler will need to work in parallel with an interpreter.

This allows for the dynamism of an interpreter while still retaining the
possibility of compiler optimizations. Furthermore, due to its nature, a JIT
compiler has access to dynamic information which it can use for further
optimizations that a traditional _Ahead-of-Time_ (AOT) compiler would not be
able to perform.

JIT compilers are typically very well suited for Dynamic programming languages
(e.g. LISP, JavaScript, Python, etc.)
