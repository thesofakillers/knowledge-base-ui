When tagging notes within a [zettelkasten system](./2020-08-24t15-19-14z.md)
[@ahrensHowTakeSmart2017] and elsewhere, the tags should help in _retrieval_
rather than _archival_. 

This means that the tags should aid the user in finding the notes, rather than
simply giving structure to the notes by organizing in some implicit
categorization.

We can achieve this by using the tags to provide _context_ to the notes. Ask
yourself, in which circumstance would it be convenient to find this note? This
suggestion is also found in Getting Things Done [@hambergGTD15Minutes2010]. 

For example, we may tag a task that we can only complete while using a computer
with the tag "computer". This allows us to know exactly what we need to do when
we are using a computer.
