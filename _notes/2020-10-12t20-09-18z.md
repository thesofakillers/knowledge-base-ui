title: Implementing Forward-mode Autodiff

By nature of the chain rule and how we compute [forward-mode autodiff](./2020-10-08t15-33-40z.md), 
we obtain the intermediate derivatives in the same order as the intermediate
representations of the function are presented. The order of the program remains
unchanged. 

This gives us 2 insights:

1. The intermediate derivatives can be interleaved into the original program.
2. As such we can observe that the intermediate derivatives depend on the
   intermediate representations, so they can be calculated together.

Insight 1 may push us to implement forward-mode autodiff via 
[source-code transformation](./2020-10-09t14-24-36z.md), while insight 2 may 
push us to implement forward-mode autodiff via 
[operator overloading](./2020-10-09t14-22-09z.md)
