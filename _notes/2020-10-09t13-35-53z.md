In mathematics, a closed-form expression is any expression which uses symbols
and operations taken from a standard finite set. This could mean expressions
that only use addition/subtraction/multiplication/division for example.

Typically, limits, derivatives, integrals and control-flows are not considered
to be allowed in closed-form expression.
