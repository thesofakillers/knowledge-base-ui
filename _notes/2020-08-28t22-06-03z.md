The [Zettelkasten system](./2020-08-24t15-19-14z.md) is purposely designed to
constantly provide the user with feedback, given the benefits of
[feedback](./2020-08-26t10-01-09z.md) on learning and enjoyment
[@ahrensHowTakeSmart2017]. The zettelkasten gives the user feedback in the
following ways:

- By forcing yourself to write while you read, you get feedback on your understanding.
- By making permanent notes from your literature and fleeting notes, you get
  feedback on your writing
- By making connections to existing permanent notes, you get feedback on gaps
  in your thinking and on your writing.
