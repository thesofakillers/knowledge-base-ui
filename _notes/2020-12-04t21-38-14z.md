[Notes from PG's essay](http://www.paulgraham.com/schlep.html)

- A schlep is a tedious and undesirable task

- One may not realize, but running a company is riddled with schleps, and in
  fact one could argue consists mostly in doing schleps.
  - you can't start a startup just by writing code.

- schleps should be dealt with as soon as possible: just dive in.

- _Schlep Business_ is a phenomenon defined by Paul Graham in which our mind
  subconsciously convinces us not to do something because of the amount of
  schleps associated with doing that thing.
  - The subconscious conviction is such that our mind doesn't even notice it,
    and doesn't even _see_ the thing that it could do.
 
- The issue is that scary, ambitious ideas, associated with lots of schlep, are
  typically the best for startups:
  - in addition to their intrinsic value, there's less demand for them among
    founders, so there's less competition, which as a founder is great.

- The best antidote to schlep business is ignorance
  - in this sense, younger founders have an advantage.
    - they don't know how much they'll grow, but they don't know how much
      they'll need to (i.e. how much schlep is facing them) either.

- The next best antidote is to remove yourself from the equation: What problem
  do you wish someone else would solve for me?
