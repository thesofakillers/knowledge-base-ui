title: The Importance of Writing

It is quite difficult to think deeply about something without writing your
thoughts down. In a certain sense, [writing](./2020-08-27t21-19-42z.md) is the
only thing that matters.

This is because writing things down (in your own words) forces you to
_elaborate_ on their meaning, causing you to reflect and think about what you
are writing and stimulating understanding.

Furthermore writing gives a more palpable purpose to your reading, sharpening
your focus.

Writing allows you to test your understanding (and receive
[feedback](./2020-08-26t10-01-09z.md)) by writing rephrased notes.

Writing things down [frees your mind](./2020-08-26t10-09-40z.md) to think about
more important things.

Extended practice in writing as you read will teach you how to discern good
arguments from good-sounding arguments.

Without writing, reading simply becomes an exercise in meditation in the long
run.
