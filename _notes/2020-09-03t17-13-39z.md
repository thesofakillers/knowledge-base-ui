In astronomy, scintillation is the phenomenon in which celestial objects appear
to twinkle, i.e. have random variations in their luminosity, when observed
through a medium. 

This is due to the turbulence in the earth's atmosphere (atmospheric
scintillation), or due to turbulence in some other medium (such as the
celestial body's own atmosphere) (astronomical scintillation)

Turbulence causes scintillation because it perturbs the otherwise flat
wavefronts of light.
