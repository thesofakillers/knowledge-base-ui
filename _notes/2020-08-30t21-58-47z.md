Adaptive Optics is a method for accounting for the effects of
[Optical Turbulence](./2020-08-30t21-46-22z.md) on ground-based observations by
deforming the mirrors of the telescope so to counteract the turbulence in the
atmosphere [@informationeso.orgAdaptiveOptics].

This is done in real-time by using a bright reference star whose true magnitude
we know of and observing the effect of the atmosphere on it. 

In the absence of a natural reference star, an artificial reference star can be
created utilizing high power lasers to excite particles beyond the turbulent
atmosphere, causing them to emit radiation and simulate a star.
