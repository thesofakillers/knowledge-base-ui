title: Rely on Understanding rather than Short-term Memory

Just like [attention](./2020-08-28t17-40-26z.md), our short-term memory is
limited. It has been shown that we can hold a maximum of 7 +/- 2 things in our
mind at any given time [@ahrensHowTakeSmart2017].

We can "hack" our short-term memory by "bundling" things together, i.e.
grouping related things together so to find them via connections. ( See
<./2020-08-26t10-09-40z.md> for another way we can "hack" our memory. )

In a way, this is similar to the notion of _understanding_, where concepts and
ideas are internally connected in our brain. That's why it is so easy to
remember things we understand. One could argue it doesn't even feel like memory comes into play.
