In [time series](./2020-09-23t15-18-55z.md) analysis
Autoregressive-moving-average models are simply the combination through
addition of [autoregressive](./2020-09-23t15-14-39z.md) and
[moving-average](2020-09-29t12-46-47z.md) models for time series prediction.

As such, they are defined by the autoregressive order $p$ and the
moving-average order $q$. Mathematically, we can write an ARMA(p,q) model as

$$ 
X_{t}=c+\varepsilon _{t}+\sum _{i=1}^{p}\varphi
_{i}X_{t-i}+\sum _{i=1}^{q}\theta _{i}\varepsilon _{t-i} 
$$

Note, the ARMA model can only be used on
[stationary](./2020-09-29t13-59-43z.md) time series.
