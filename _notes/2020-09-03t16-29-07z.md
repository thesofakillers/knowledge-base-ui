MASS (Multi Aperture Scintillation Sensor) is an instrument for profiling the
vertical distribution of [seeing](./2020-08-30t21-49-34z.md) within the
atmosphere through the analysis of the
[scintillation](./2020-09-03t17-13-39z.md) of bright stars.

The spatial scale of scintillation is dependant on the distance to the
turbulent layer that causes the scintillation. This dependence is used to
separate the contributions from specific layers to the observed scintillation,
hence constructing the vertical distribution of seeing mentioned above.

This is done by means of 4 ring apertures connected to photon counters which
measure the [scintillation index](./2020-09-03t17-25-35z.md) (spatial scale of
scintillation) and _differential scintillation index_, which is simply the
normalized ratio of scintillation indices between two apertures.

Both scintillation and differential scintillation indices are related to the
turbulence intensity of a given layer through the computation of some weights
dependent on the distance to the layer and the shape and size of the aperture.

Given that we can recover all these quantities, we can then solve for
turbulence intensity (and hence seeing) across various heights in the atmosphere.
