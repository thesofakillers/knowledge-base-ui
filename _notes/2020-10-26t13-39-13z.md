title: Rolling Cross Validation for Time Series problems

Due to the sequential nature of the data in
[time series](./2020-09-23t15-18-55z.md) problems, traditional
[k-fold](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)#k-fold_cross-validation>)
[cross-validation](./2020-09-23t14-52-52z.md) can be problematic, since adjacent
data are not independent as assumed, causing data leakage.

Therefore the typical time series approach when it comes to cross-validation is
to apply _rolling_ cross-validation. Here, like in k-fold cross-validation, we
split the data in training and validation sets $k$ times. However, the
validation sets always follow the training sets chronologically. This way no
future observations can be used in constructing the forecast. This is
illustrated well in the images below taken from Rob J. Hyndman's website:
