In the process of [hypohtesis testing](./2020-09-07t14-04-03z.md), the ultimate
outcome is either the rejection or the failure to reject the null hypothesis,
based on how small the probability of observing a certain phenomenon is
compared to a given significance threshold.

Since the setting of the significance threshold ($\alpha$) is not an exact and
extremely rigorous process, this can often result in errors. These errors are
categorized as type I and type II errors.

- a _type I_ error occurs when the null hypothesis is erroneously rejected
  (false positive).
- a _type II_ error occurs when the null hypothesis is erroneously
  non-rejected (false negative).
