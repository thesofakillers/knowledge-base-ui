There is a wide gamut of "types" of attention, ranging from focused attention
to something we may refer to as 'floating' attention
[@ahrensHowTakeSmart2017].

- Focused attention is the state of mind in which you are rigidly and intensely
  focusing on a specific task. Examples include:
  - Solving a maths problem
  - fixing a mechanical issue
  - tying a knot
- Floating attention is the state of mind in which we are flexibly and more
  relaxedly thinking about a specific topic, in a more playful and
  exploratory mood. Examples include:
  - daydreaming
  - open, friendly discussion with friends
  - envisioning/surmising.
