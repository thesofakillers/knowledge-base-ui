title: Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF)

When calculating the [autocorrelation function](./2020-09-28t19-30-00z.md) for
a given signal and delay, this calculation does not take into account the
indirect effects on the correlation caused by other lags.

PACF allows us to only calculate the direct effects of a given lag by taking
the partial correlation.

We do this by isolating the coefficients for each lag. This is done by writing
a regression function along the lines of the following, using an example of
$k=2$, where $k$ is the lag extent:

$$
x_t = \phi_{21} x_{t-1} + \phi_{22} x_{t-2} + \epsilon_t 
$$

The coefficient $\phi_{22}$ quantifies the _direct_ effects of the lag of 2 on
the time series. In fact, it is $\phi_{22}$ _is_ the PACF for this particular
case. 

Each time we are interested in a new PACF, i.e. for a different lag, we need to
build a new regression model including more or less terms, to mirror what is
done above.

Eventually, we may collect the PACF for a series of lags, and produce a PACF
plot

This plot allows us to observe at a glance which lags have a significant
correlation with our time series to warrant an autoregressive model.
