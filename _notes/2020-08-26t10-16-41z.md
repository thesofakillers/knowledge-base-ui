title: How to fight Confirmation Bias

Confirmation Bias is a flaw in our psychology wherein we tend to gravitate
towards what we like, which is typically anything that confirms our
pre-existing beliefs. This causes us to fall into an echo chamber, where we are
unaware of our knowledge gaps and become confident in our ignorance of our
point of view.

We can combat Confirmation Bias by taking a bottom-up approach, focused on
optimizing relevancy, as is done in the [Zettelkasten method](./2020-08-24t15-19-14z.md). 

A bottom-up approach means building things from small, not necessarily
structured details rather than starting from a big idea and filling in the
required details as you go. 

This prevents you from defining a direction from the start, forcing you into
optimizing for relevancy - anything that connects to previous small ideas is
considered, until a well-rounded opinion can be formed.
