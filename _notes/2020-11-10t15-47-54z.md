Most if not all models will have some uncertainty in their outputs. This
uncertainty is typically caused by noise in the input data. Here we will focus
on two types of noise, measurement and process noise.

Data is really the result of the _measurement_ of some phenomenon. Because it
is unlikely for a measurement instrument to be perfect, every measurement will
be accompanied by some uncertainty, which we refer to as **measurement noise**.

**Process noise** on the other hand is any kind of uncertainty due to external
factors that the model does not account for yet. In the case of a trajectory
estimation problem where the model utilizes Newton's equations of motion for
example, this may be the effect of wind on the projectile, which is not
accounted for in the model equations.
