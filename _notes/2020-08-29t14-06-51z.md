rather memory suppression. We suppress memories we deem irrelevant or do not
understand, to avoid constantly being bombarded by irrelevant memories, which
would interrupt our [focus](./2020-08-28t17-40-26z.md).

Recalling is therefore the process of finding the right connections leading to
the correct stored memory. Learning can then be said to be the process of
ensuring that the right cues lead to the right memories, by ensuring that the
right connections exist between topics in our brain.

The most effective way of learning is therefore not based on storage
optimization, but instead based on optimizing the quantity and quality of
connections between individual pieces of information, or memories.

This way of learning fosters [understanding](./2020-08-26t10-04-56z.md).
