Confirmation Bias is a flaw in our psychology wherein we tend to gravitate
towards what we like, which is typically anything that confirms our
pre-existing beliefs. This causes us to fall into an echo chamber, where we are
unaware of our knowledge gaps and become confident in our ignorance of our
point of view.
