In [time series](./2020-09-23t15-18-55z.md) analysis, Autoregressive (AR)
Models are models that predict the next time-step of a quantity by utilizing
the previous time-step values (lags) of that same quantity.

We can build an AR model by making use of [PACF](./2020-09-28t19-43-17z.md),
analysis, determining which time lags have the strongest correlation for our
signal.

Having observed the most strongly correlated lags, we can then write a simple
function where the parameters are the lags, e.g.

$$
x_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{t-1} + \beta_3 x_{t-3} + \beta_4 x_{t-4}
+ \beta_12 x_{t-12} + \epsilon_t
$$

For a monthly time series that is sensitive to monthly, quarterly, four-monthly
and yearly effects. We are then left with the tasks of fitting the weights
($\beta$).

Note, an autoregressive model can only be used on
[stationary](./2020-09-29t13-59-43z.md) time series.
