Jet Streams are strong, narrow and meandering air currents that form in the
atmospheres of certain planets including Earth [@JetStream2020].

Earth has 4 distinct Jet Streams: 2 stronger _polar jets_ (~ 60°, 9-12 km AMSL)
and 2 slightly weaker _subtropical jets_ (~ 30°, 10-16 km AMSL), all flowing
from west to east (westerly), at speeds of roughly 180 km/h on average.

In general, Jet Streams can be said to form when warm air masses meet cold air
masses, a difference that arises due to the fact that the Sun does not heat the
Earth evenly [@WhatJetStream].

This is however a bit of a simplification and in fact the
[Coriolis force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolis_force)
(caused by Earth's spin on its axis) also comes into play [@JetStream2020].
