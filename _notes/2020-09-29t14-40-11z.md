In [time series](./2020-09-23t15-18-55z.md) forecasting, when dealing with
non-[stationary](./2020-09-29t13-59-43z.md) data, the
autoregressive-integrated-moving-average model can come in handy. 

As the name suggests, ARIMA is simply an extension of
[ARMA](./2020-09-29t13-51-00z.md) that manages to handle non-stationary data
through an integration.

More specifically, similarly to what we do in
[this note](./2020-09-29t14-22-50z.md), we re-write the series in terms of the
difference of consecutive values, apply ARMA on this new series, and then work
our way backwards to the original series.

Mathematically, given a non-stationary series $y_t$, for a first order
differenced (d = 1) ARIMA model we write the new series as

$$
z_t = a_{t+1} - a_t
$$

We can then apply the ARMA model to this new series to get

$$
{z_{t}=c+\varepsilon _{t}+\sum _{i=1}^{p}\varphi _{i}z_{t-i}+\sum _{i=1}^{q}\theta _{i}\varepsilon _{t-i}.\,}
$$

Now obviously, we wish to recover $a_t$. To do this, we set shift the original
equation, writing it as 

$$
\begin{aligned}
z_{t-1} &= a_t - a_{t-1}
a_t &= z_{t-1} - a_{t-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

Noticing the structure of the latter equation, we can then apply a recurrence
relation to replace all instances of $a$ on the RHS, obtaining

$$
a_t = a_{t-1} + \sum_{i=1}^{k-t} z_{k-i}.
$$

We can then substitute the ARMA model of $z_t$ we defined earlier to have our
full ARIMA model depending on on 3 parameters, $p. q. d$. $p$ and $q$ are the
same parameters found in ARMA and $d$ parametrizes the amount of integrations
we perform.

Note, throughout this derivation, we utilized a degree of differencing $d = 1$.
While this is the most commonly used value for the parameter, it doesn't allow
us to generalize the model. A degree of differencing of 1 was used only to help
with intuition.
