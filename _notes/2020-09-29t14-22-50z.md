To make a non-stationary series $y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 t + \epsilon_t$
[stationary](./2020-09-29t13-59-43z.md), we simply take the difference of
consecutive values of $y_t$ and use that as our series:

$$
z_t = y_t - y_{t-1}
$$

We can prove this is stationary (assuming it is not seasonal) with the
following

Substituting $y_t$ into the equation above we have

$$
= (\beta_0 + \beta_1 t + \epsilon_t) - (\beta_0 + \beta_1(t - 1)
 \epsilon_{t-1}
$$
$$
= \beta_1 + (\epsilon_t + \epsilon_{t-1})
$$

Since we assume the errors to originate mutually independently from the same
normal distribution centred at 0 and with variance of $k^2$, we find that this
process indeed gives us a constant mean of $\mu_{z_t} = \beta_1$ and constant
variance of $2k^2$, hence satisfying stationarity.

Note, this method does not always work, and relies on the assumption that there
weren't any seasonal effects in the original series.
