A Wind Rose is a kind of data visualization used to illustrate how wind speed
and direction are distributed on average at a certain location.

In a way it is a histogram projected into polar coordinates, where each bin
corresponds to a direction on a North - East - South - West plot. The colors of
the bars correspond to wind speed, and the height to the frequency of the wind
in that direction.
