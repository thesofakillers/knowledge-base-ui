A FASS (Full Aperture Seeing Sensor) is a technique for atmospheric turbulence
monitoring based on high resolution CCD Fourier processing of scintillation
images [@guesalagaFASSFullAperture2016], to replace well known
[MASS](./2020-09-03t16-29-07z.md) and [DIMM](./2020-09-02t17-19-14z.md)
alternatives.
