While the [Zettelkasten](./2020-08-24t15-19-14z.md) aims to emphasize a lack of
top down structure, it may be useful to provide a minimal notion of one to
_facilitate navigation_ within the slip box.

We can do this via Index and Structure notes.

- Index Notes are simply lists of Structure Notes.
- Structure Notes are notes that provide an overview of a topic, providing
  links when appropriate
