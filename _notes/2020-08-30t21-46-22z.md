Optical Turbulence (OT) is a phenomenon in which wavefronts from celestial bodies
are perturbed when passing through our atmosphere, due to small fluctuations in
the atmosphere's refractive index [@hagelinOpticalTurbulenceInfluence].

These fluctuations arise due to [wind shear](./2020-08-30t21-55-33z.md) and
thermally stable stratification of the atmosphere.

The effect of the perturbation of the wavefronts is a lower resolution in
ground-based observations, quantified by the metric known as
[seeing](./2020-08-30t21-49-34z.md). Due to this lower resolution, point
sources of light have an apparent angular diameter when observed through the
atmosphere.

OT is most intense near sea level, followed by a second spike near the
[jet-stream](./2020-08-30t21-57-31z.md).

The issues presented by OT can be addressed via the use of
[Adaptive Optics](./2020-08-30t21-58-47z.md).
