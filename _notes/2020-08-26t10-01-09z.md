To maximise our productivity and enjoyment when working, it is important to do
work that energizes us and keeps us engaged. But how? 

One way of achieving this is by ensuring that our workflow allows for positive
feedback loops to form, wherein we are constantly rewarded by the work we do.
The reward will make us want to do more, since we enjoy it, and this will lead
to more rewards forming the positive feedback loop mentioned above.

Positive feedback motivates us because it signals to us that we are getting
better, which is an awesome feeling.

However, to receive positive feedback, we need to be open to all forms of
feedback, including negative feedback. This is because without negative
feedback, we cannot know what to improve on, and cannot as such cannot improve
and obtain the aforementioned positive feedback. This mentality is known as the
_growth mindset_ [@ahrensHowTakeSmart2017].
