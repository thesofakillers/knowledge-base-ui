Wind Shear is a change in wind over a relatively short distance. Wind is
a vector, so this can be a change in direction and/or magnitude (wind speed).

Wind shear can either classified into:

- horizontal wind shear: Variation in wind speed and/or direction over
  a distance at a given altitude
- vertical wind shear: Variation in wind speed and/or direction over a range of
  altitude.
