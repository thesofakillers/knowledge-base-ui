The Zeigarnik Effect describes the phenomenon wherein pending tasks occupy our
short-term memory until they are completed OR until they are written down in
a way that convinces us that they will be taken care of eventually
[@ahrensHowTakeSmart2017].

As such, writing down less important and urgent tasks and ideas creates space
in our minds for ruminating and focusing on more complex topics.
