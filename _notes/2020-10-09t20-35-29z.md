We define _dual numbers_ as the set of numbers $a + b\epsilon$ where $a, b \in
\mathbb{R}$ and $\epsilon^2 = 0$. 

Just how we can [represent complex numbers as matrices](./2020-10-12t20-26-57z.md),
an analog isomorphism is present with dual numbers. In fact the
[ring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_f7O-4Rb9U) of dual numbers can be
represented by the $2 \times 2$ matrices of the form

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
a & 0 \\
b & a
\end{pmatrix}.
$$

Basic operations are straightforward:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  (a+b\epsilon) + (c+d\epsilon) &= (a+c) + (b+d)\epsilon \\ 
  (a+b\epsilon) (c+d\epsilon) &= ac + (ad+bc)\epsilon \\ 
  \frac{a+b\epsilon}{c+d\epsilon} &= \frac ac + \frac{bc - ad}{c^2}\epsilon.
\end{aligned}
$$
