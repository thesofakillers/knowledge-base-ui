When utilizing [autoregressive models](./2020-09-23t15-14-39z.md) we are
interested in correlation of the signal with a delayed copy of itself. This is
known as autocorrelation. 

We can calculate the autocorrelation function (ACF) of a signal and a particular
lag amount by calculating the [Pearson Correlation](./2020-09-28t14-34-27z.md)
of the time series and its lagged duplicate equivalent.

In other words, we treat the time series as the X variable, and then take each
point in the time series and shift it by whatever lag we're interested in and
use that as the Y variable.
