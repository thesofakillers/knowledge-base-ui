The Free Atmosphere is the portion of the atmosphere situated far enough from
the surface of the Earth that frictional effects of the surface onto the air
are negligible.

In this portion of the atmosphere, the air is treated like an ideal fluid, i.e.
an incompressible fluid.

The plane at which the surface friction becomes negligible and the atmosphere
starts being referred to as free atmosphere is known as the _planetary boundary
layer_.
