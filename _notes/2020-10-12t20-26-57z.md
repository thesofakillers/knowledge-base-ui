For any given [group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)), it is
often desirable to find an
[isomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism) of this group to
a matrix form. In other words, it is often desirable to find the equivalent
representation of a related set of numbers in terms of matrices. This is to be
able to use the various techniques of Linear Algebra as well as the
computational advantages that matrices may bring.

Such an approach was done for complex numbers, i.e. numbers of the form $z=a
+ bi$.

To find this isomorphism, it would be intuitive to start thinking in terms of
rotational transformations, given their relation to both matrices and complex
numbers. 

Consider the two basis vectors $\braket{1, 0}$ and $\braket{0, 1}$. Suppose we
transform this vector space by rotating it anticlockwise by an angle $\theta$
about the origin. This rotation will map our basis vectors respectively to the
new vectors $\braket{\cos{\theta}, \sin{\theta}}$ and $\braket{-\sin{theta},
\cos{\theta}}$. We can represent this transformation as a matrix $R_{\theta}$:

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
\cos{\theta} & -\sin{\theta}\\
\sin{\theta} & \cos{\theta} 
\end{pmatrix}.
$$

This can be re-written as 

$$
\cos{\theta}
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0\\
0 & 1 
\end{pmatrix}
+
\sin{\theta}
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & -1\\
1 & 0 
\end{pmatrix}.
$$

The matrix $J = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1\\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$ behaves similarly
to $i$, in that $i^2 = -1$ maps isomorphically to $J^2 = -I$. In fact we can
notice that the matrix representation above is awfully similar to Euler's
formula:

$$
e^{i\theta} = cos{\theta} + i\sin{\theta}.
$$

This makes sense, since multiplying by $e^{i\theta}$ represents a rotation
about the origin through an angle $\theta$, just like out matrix. Just how we
can generalize $e^{i\theta}$ to $re^{i\theta}$ to represent any complex number,
we can do the same with out matrix, since this just requires multiplying by
a constant $r$:

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
r\cos{\theta} & -r\sin{\theta}\\
r\sin{\theta} & r\cos{\theta} 
\end{pmatrix}.
$$

Setting $a = \cos{\theta}$ and $b = \sin{\theta}$, we see that any complex
number of the form $z = a + bi$ can be represented equivalently by a matrix of
the form 

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
a & -b\\
b & a
\end{pmatrix}.
$$
