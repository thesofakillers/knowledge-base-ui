In [time series](./2020-09-23t15-18-55z.md) analysis, a moving-average model is
a model that predicts the value of a signal given a linear combination of the
lagged errors of the model and the mean of the series. 

Mathematically

$$
\displaystyle X_{t}=\mu +\varepsilon _{t}+\theta _{1}\varepsilon _{t-1}+\cdots +\theta _{q}\varepsilon _{t-q}
$$

or

$$
\displaystyle X_{t}=\mu +(1+\theta _{1}B+\cdots +\theta _{q}B^{q})\varepsilon _{t}
$$

The moving-average is thus a linear regression of the current value of the
series against current and previous observed errors. The errors are assumed to
be mutually independent and to originate from the same, normal distribution,
centred at 0 with a standard deviation of 1.

There can be various "orders" of a moving-average model, denoted by the letter
$q$ in the equations above. We typically refer to a moving-average model with
the $MA(q)$ notation.

Just how in [autoregressive models](./2020-09-23t15-14-39z.md) we make use of
[PACF](./2020-09-28t19-43-17z.md) analysis for determining the order of the
model, we can do the same in MA models by using
[ACF](./2020-09-28t19-30-00z.md) analysis.
