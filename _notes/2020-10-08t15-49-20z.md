The LLVM project is a collection of modular and reusable compiler technologies.
One can almost think of it as a framework for writing your own compiler, so to
implement new programming languages. Languages such as Swift, Rust and Kotlin
were all born in part thanks to LLVM. 

LLVM's original goal was to provide a modern SSA-based compilation strategy
capable of supporting both static and [dynamic](./2020-10-08t15-19-20z.md)
compilation of arbitrary programming languages.

Since then, many subprojects have spawned, including debuggers like LLDB and
language implementations such as libc++.
