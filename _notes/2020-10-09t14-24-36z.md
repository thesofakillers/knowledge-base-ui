title: Source code transformation for Autodiff 
id: 2020-10-09t14-24-36z
---

As we saw, [forward-mode autodiff](./2020-10-08t15-33-40z.md) allows for the
interleaving of intermediate differentials to compute the derivative of a given
function.

One way of implementing this is explicitly interleaving these intermediate
differentials into the source program, by using a compiler that transforms the
source code into a differential version of itself.

Interestingly, source code transformation can also be used for
[reverse-mode autodiff](2020-10-08t15-31-20z), as is done in
[Zygote](https://github.com/FluxML/Zygote.jl) [@innesDonUnrollAdjoint2019] and
[Tangent](https://github.com/google/tangent)
