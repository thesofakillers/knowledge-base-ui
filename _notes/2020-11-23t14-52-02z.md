In [statistics](./2020-09-14t14-24-41z.md), it is often a desired condition
that the errors are normally distributed.

A Box-Cox transformation is used for this exact reason to _transform_
non-normally distributed data into normally distributed data.

This is done by estimating some parameter $\lambda$ that normalizes our
variable $y$ in the following set of equations:

$$ y_{i}^{(\lambda )}={\begin{cases}{\dfrac {y_{i}^{\lambda }-1}{\lambda
}}&{\text{if }}\lambda \neq 0,\\\ln y_{i}&{\text{if }}\lambda =0,\end{cases}}
$$
