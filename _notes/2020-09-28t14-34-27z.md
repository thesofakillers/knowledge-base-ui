In [statistics](2020-09-14t14-24-41z.md), Pearson's r correlation coefficient
quantifies the linear correlation between two variables X and Y.

The value is always between -1 and 1.

- A value of 1 indicates a strong positive linear correlation.
- A value of 0 indicates no correlation.
- A value of -1 indicates a strong negative linear correlation.

One will find, that unlike [covariance](./2020-09-28t14-45-37z.md), correlation
is scale-invariant, i.e. the scale of the data does not ultimately affect the
correlation value.

Our _confidence_ in our correlation value depends on how much data we have and
is quantified by the _p-value_. This value tells us the probability that
randomly sampled points would result in a similarly strong if not stronger
relationship. The lower the _p-value_, the less likely that our correlation is
due to randomness, and therefore the more confidence we are in our correlation
value. This is in a way similar to
[hypothesis testing](./2020-09-07t14-04-03z.md)

Mathematically, the Pearson correlation between two variables X and Y is
defined as the covariance between the two variables over the product of their
variances:

$$
{\displaystyle \rho _{X,Y}={\frac {\operatorname {cov} (X,Y)}{\sigma _{X}\sigma _{Y} } } }
$$
