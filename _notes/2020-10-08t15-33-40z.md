[Autodiff](./2020-10-08t15-20-39z.md) is a way of computing derivatives of an
arbitrary function with respect to one or more of its input variables through
the use of repeated applications of the chain rule on intermediate
representations underlying the original function.

Forward-mode autodiff consists in evaluating the chain rule from the inside to
the outside, i.e. starting the computation from the innermost representation.

For a function $y(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$ with intermediate representations $w_i$, the derivative with
respect to a given input variable $x_k$ will be given by the following recursive
relation:

$$
{\frac{\partial y}{\partial x_k}}={\frac {\partial y}{\partial w_{i-1}}}{\frac {\partial w_{i-1}}{\partial x_k}}={\frac {\partial y}{\partial w_{i-1}}}\left({\frac {\partial w_{i-1}}{\partial w_{i-2}}}{\frac {\partial w_{i-2}}{\partial x_k}}\right)={\frac {\partial y}{\partial w_{i-1}}}\left({\frac {\partial w_{i-1}}{\partial w_{i-2}}}\left({\frac {\partial w_{i-2}}{\partial w_{i-3}}}{\frac {\partial w_{i-3}}{\partial x_k}}\right)\right)=\cdots
$$

In the example computational graph shown below, forward-mode AD flows from the
innermost representations to the outermost:

To differentiate _automatically_, we will need to eventually define a set of
rules to apply for computing the derivatives of the primitives of our function,
the most basic operations which we use to split our function into its
intermediate representations. Once we have these rules, the complete derivative
can be calculated as described above by utilizing the chain rule.

As one may have noticed from the definitions above, each pass of forward-mode
autodiff computes the derivative with respect to a single input variable. The
selection of this input variable sets the _seeds_ of the computation, i.e. the
values of the innermost derivatives in the chain rule.

As such, the cost of running forward-mode autodiff scales linearly with the
number of input variables $n$, i.e. it is an $O(n)$ operation.
