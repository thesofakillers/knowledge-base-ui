It has been shown that decision-making is one of the most exhausting activities
of our day to day lives [@ahrensHowTakeSmart2017].

Reducing the number of decisions we need to take can hence save energy and
willpower that we can more wisely allocate towards more important endeavours,
such as writing.

Organizational systems such as the Zettelkasten, which make the decisions for
us, or simply eliminate decisions, can help achieve this more efficient
willpower allocation.
